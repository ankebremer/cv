### Software Developer
[Nucleus Financial](https://www.nucleusfinancial.com/) _(April 2017 - May 2021)_ <br>
A wrap platform to manage wealth with a focus on pension products.

* Improved the tax estimate calculation by using latest fund data provided on a daily basis from a financial data provider
* Improved the performance of an algorithm calculating and backfilling historic tax estimates into a DB. Those were to be integrated into our platform reporting tool. I reduced the runtime from several days to 3 hours 
* Participated in implementing a daily report to support advisers in being compliant with MiFID II regulations
* Participated in implementing a solution to calculate fee rebates for cutomers based on different criteria. This involved designing the logic to determine eligible customers as well as implementing the calculation.
* Supported a DB upgrade which involved extensive testing and analysis across all our internal applications and a partial re-write of a number of platform reports due to schema changes.
* Participated in the development of a Hypermedia RESTful API
* SQL performance tuning to improve download time of platform reports
* Analysed and fixed bugs across the code base

### Junior Software Developer
[Nucleus Financial](https://www.nucleusfinancial.com/) _(April 2015 - April 2017)_ <br>
A wrap platform to manage wealth with a focus on pension products.

* Participated in code reviews, planning meetings, refinements and software releases
* Designed and implemented a scheduled mechanism to obtain and store historic data as well as daily updates of MSCI benchmarks data. This provided a source for our performance tool to allow the generation of benchmark overlays. The project involved analysing files and data provided by MSCI, designing a DB structure to store the benchmark data, and populating the DB with historic data. The DB structure was well-designed and allowed us to easily import data from other benchmark providers into the same schema a few years later and is currently still in use.
* Designed and implemented a solution to produce monthly and quarterly reports for PEP and AML sanction checks in cooperation with Business Analysts and the Financial Crime team
* Implemented an automated solution for the calculation of tax estimates for Onshore bond accounts. I transformed a manual, time-consuming, spreadsheet driven calculation from a daily 4-hour long process into a fast and reliable calculation that generateed the report in under 3 minutes.
* _Technologies used:_ Java, SQL (Oracle and Postgres), Spring, Querydsl


## Personal
